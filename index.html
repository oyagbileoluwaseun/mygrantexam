        question:"Schools expect textbooks to be a valuable source of information for students. My research suggests, however, that textbooks that address the place of Native Americans within the history of the United States distort history to suit a particular cultural value system. In some textbooks, for example, settlers are pictured as more humane, complex, skillful, and wise than Native Americans. In essence, textbooks stereotype and depreciate the numerous Native American cultures while reinforcing the attitude that the European conquest of the New World denotes the superiority of European cultures. Although textbooks evaluate Native American architecture, political systems, and homemaking, I contend that they do it from an ethnocentric, European perspective without recognizing that other perspectives are possible. Which of the following best summarise the title of this passage path ?",
        choice1:"Specific ways to evaluate the biases of United States history textbooks",
        choice2:"Nontraditional methods of teaching United States history",

Accordingly, in this country's coastal regions, where the climate is generally most temperate, the population is likely to grow, while other regions are likely to suffer population declines. Paul: I disagree. With few exceptions, regions where the climate is harsh are characterized by comparatively low living costs, a compelling factor for retired people with little savings and on fixed incomes.

Just like humans, fish need oxygen to survive, and so in ocean areas experiencing significant levels of oxygen scarcity, or hypoxia, fish populations are plummeting. Although some hypoxic areas, called “dead zones,” occur naturally, hypoxia in coastal areas and inland waters is caused mainly by agricultural run-off and by discharge of industrial waste waters. More than one-hundred permanent dead zones, many covering thousands of square miles, exist worldwide today.Since reproductive success is the most critical factor in the sustainability of any species, the extent of this threat to marine life and genetic diversity can hardly be overstated.

        question:"The encounter that a portrait records is most tangibly the sitting itself, which may be brief or extended, collegial or confrontational. Renowned photographer Cartier-Bresson has expressed his passion for portrait photography by characterizing it as a duel without rules, a delicate rape. Such metaphors contrast quite sharply with Richard Avedon's conception of a sitting. While Cartier-Bresson reveals himself as an interloper and opportunist, Avedon confesses — perhaps uncomfortably — to a role as diagnostician and (by implication) psychic healer: not as someone who necessarily transforms his subjects, but as someone who reveals their essential nature. Both photographers, however, agree that the fundamental dynamic in this process lies squarely in the hands of the artist. Which of the following best characterizes a Cartier-Bresson portrait sitting?",
        choice1:"an awkward exchange",
        choice2:"a mutual exploitation",
        choice3:"an uninvited intrusion",

        question:"A quite-different paradigm has its roots not in confrontation or consultation but in active collaboration between the artist and sitter. This very different kind of relationship was formulated most vividly by William Hazlitt in his essay entitled On Sitting for One's Picture (1823). To Hazlitt, the bond of connection between painter and sitter is most like the relationship between two lovers. Hazlitt fleshes out his thesis by recalling the career of Sir Joshua Reynolds. According to Hazlitt, Reynold's sitters were meant to enjoy an atmosphere that was both comfortable for them and conducive to the enterprise of the portrait painter, who was simultaneously their host and their contractual employee. In the case of artists like Reynolds, no fundamental difference exists between the artist's studio and all those other rooms in which the sitters spin out the days of their lives. The act of entering Reynold's studio — this social and aesthetic encounter — did not necessarily transform those who sat for him. Based on the passage information, with which of the following statements would both Avedon and Reynolds most likely agree? ",
        choice1:"Control of the portrait-sitting experience should lie with the artist.",
        choice2:"A portrait is most likely to reveal the subject's true self when the sitting takes place in a setting familiar to the subject.",
        choice3:"During portrait sittings, subjects often enjoy revealing secrets about themselves to the artist.",
        choice4:"A person can gain new insight into himself or herself by sitting for a portrait.",

        question:"Recent dental research shows that bacteria around the gum line produces a substance that in sufficient amounts can induce preterm labor in pregnant women and can cause heart disease by clogging arteries. Both medical outcomes add to payouts by health insurers to medical-service providers. The bacteria is best removed by a dentist or trained hygienist during a routine cleaning. One health insurer has calculated that it can reduce its payouts by reimbursing subscribers who are either pregnant or at high risk of developing heart disease for the cost of one professional dental cleaning per year.Which of the following, if true, most stongly supports the assertion that the insurer's payouts to medical-service providers will decrease if it implements the reimbursement plan described above?",
        choice1:"Dental-hygiene regimens such as brushing or flossing can slow the accumulation of the bacteria-produced substance.",
        choice2:"The risk of developing heart disease is greater for individuals with a family history of heart disease than for those with no such history.",
        choice3:"Pregnant women typically crave sugary foods, which are proven to contribute to tooth decay.",
